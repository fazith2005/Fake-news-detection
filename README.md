# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📁 Files

- `NM-Project sc.pdf`: Main notebook containing code, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TfidfVectorizer
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / Naive Bayes (depending on your model)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the dataset (removing stopwords, cleaning text, etc.).
2. Vectorize the text using TF-IDF.
3. Train a machine learning classifier to distinguish between real and fake news.
4. Evaluate the model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `NM-Project sc.pdf` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Sample Output

- Model Accuracy: ~95% (depends on your data and model)
- Confusion matrix and classification report
